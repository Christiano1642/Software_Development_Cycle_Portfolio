#### Essential Questions for the Computer Science Program

1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
   - To interpret user needs, we gather feedback directly from the client and users, translating their goals into specific program functionalities. User stories help break down these requirements into small, actionable tasks, making it easier to prioritize and ensure that the program addresses user needs step by step. For SNHU Travel, for example, we created user stories based on feedback from focus groups, which allowed us to integrate features like personalized travel suggestions.

2. **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
   - I approach development iteratively, ensuring continuous feedback and adaptability to changing requirements. In future projects, I plan to incorporate Agile processes such as **Sprint Planning** to set focused goals, **Daily Stand-ups** to monitor progress, and **Retrospectives** for reflection and improvement. These practices proved valuable in keeping the SNHU Travel project aligned with evolving needs.

3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
   - Being a good team member means actively contributing, communicating openly, and supporting collective goals. This involves respecting team processes, offering constructive feedback, and collaborating to resolve issues efficiently. In the SNHU Travel project, regular communication and shared accountability helped the team remain aligned, resolve blockers quickly, and adapt to changing project requirements.
